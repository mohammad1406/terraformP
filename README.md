## Infrastructure Terraform Project:

This project contains Terraform configuration files specifically designed to set up and manage infrastructure on Alibaba Cloud. The configuration includes all the necessary components required for a robust, scalable, and automated cloud environment, including:

Redis: For in-memory data storage, enabling fast caching and real-time data access.

MySQL: A relational database to store structured data securely and efficiently.

HTTP Servers: To handle and process incoming web traffic.

Load Balancer: To distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers, ensuring high availability and reliability.

NAT Gateway: To provide secure and efficient internet access for private resources within the cloud environment.

Other Components: Any additional infrastructure resources required to meet project specifications and ensure a seamless deployment.
The Terraform scripts are modular, reusable, and customizable, enabling you to tailor the configurations to suit specific needs. This approach simplifies infrastructure provisioning and ensures an automated, consistent, and efficient deployment process.
